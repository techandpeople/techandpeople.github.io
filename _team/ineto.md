Hello, I concluded my Computer Science PhD in March 2024 at IST Technical Institute, University of Lisbon. My research falls within the domain of Computer Science and Engineering, and I am proudly affiliated with LASIGE, Ciencias ULisboa with a focus on social agents for inclusion in schools. My research focused on novel experiences between mixed-ability children, exploring social development and group engagement within Human Robots Interactions, improving accessibility, and valuing individual abilities to create inclusive experiences. With 20 + years of experience in senior leadership, design, business, people, and change in the IT and Telecommunications Industry, embraced several technical and management areas in Digital, Customer Operations, and IT. Collaborated with many talented people having a long experience in a customer-centric approach, leading design thinking methods and agile teams to build and develop personalized and ethical experiences in digital channels & assisted channels. I aim to leverage artificial intelligence, human-centered AI, and social robots to foster a more inclusive society and design exceptional experiences, products, and services with a strong societal purpose.
