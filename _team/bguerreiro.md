I graduated with a BSc in Information Technology from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon in 2025.
I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science and Engineering, where I’m developing a project on an AI-assisted monitoring system for post-cardiac episode patients, aimed at supporting safer recovery. My work is supervised by Professor Tiago Guerreiro.

My main interests lie in design and healthcare technologies. Outside of academia, I enjoy playing video games, baking, and staying active through sports.
