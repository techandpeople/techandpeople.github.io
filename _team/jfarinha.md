João Garcia Farinha is a PhD researcher focused on neural interfaces and physiological computing, with particular interest in how brain-signal analysis can enable new forms of human-computer interaction. His research develops intent prediction systems that combine electronics, physical simulations, and data analysis to create accessible neural interfaces.

His work spans from low-level hardware design to cloud-based data processing, applied to multidisciplinary projects including tactile Braille displays and environmental monitoring systems. As a Teaching Assistant, he develops interactive learning tools and promotes hands-on education through circuit simulations and IoT projects.

He maintains a strong commitment to science outreach, having designed demonstrations on natural phenomena for school fairs that make complex concepts accessible to diverse audiences
