I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Informatics Engineering at the University of Lisbon. During my master’s studies, I focused on inclusive game design, exploring how to create competitive games for groups with mixed visual abilities, by leveraging asymmetric design principles. I am currently expanding the work of my MSc dissertation, aiming to explore direct and team-based competition scenarios for mixed visual abilities groups.
