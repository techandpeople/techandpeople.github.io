  alt-text: "On the left, there's a screenshot of the kitchen map and each room's location and appearance. The rooms are distributed in a circular manner and in each room there are interactable objects (stations and chests). These interactables are also shown in zoomed-in screenshots. On the right, there is another zoomed-in screenshot showing the player character, the visual representation of the order, inventory, and scoreboard systems, which appear at the top of the screen." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "Competitive games assume stereotypical players with equal abilities face mostly symmetric gameplay. For mixed-ability groups, equal challenges limit the design space and can be unappealing. Conversely, introducing asymmetric play raises concerns about fairness and balance. This work first explores competitive mixed-visual-ability games, focusing on understanding players' perspectives of competition, fairness, transparency, and asymmetric play. Our results reveal how disability disclosure can affect the experience, how design choices of asymmetry affect the perceived fairness, that asymmetric competition can be engaging, and the nuances between the perspectives of sighted and blind players."
