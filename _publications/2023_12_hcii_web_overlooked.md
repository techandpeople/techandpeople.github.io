# short description of the publication
description: "In this paper we explore web accessibility as a fundamental human right, emphasizing its role in enabling participation in an increasingly digitalized society for individuals with impairments. It highlights how accessibility benefits all users, challenges the perception of disability as exclusive to “others,” and examines its implementation barriers. We also address the importance of accessibility for businesses, ethical considerations, and legal obligations while advocating for broader societal commitment to inclusive design. The study underscores the need for practical measures to ensure a universally accessible digital environment."
