  alt-text: "A colorful 3D rendering of the layout used during our studies. In the center a white base marked Maps with red LEGOs making a path for the white cube-shaped robot with googly eyes. On the left, marked the CVI space, are the programming blocks with yellow base and 3D elements, and the on-demand block. To the right, marked the sighted side, are the programming blocks with a blue base. On the top center, is the green LEGO-base programming zone with two programming blocks atop the play block, a yellow forward arrow, a blue left arrow, and the red play block with a black button. There is also the overhead webcam, and the speaker to the left side." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "We ran a user study where 6 mixed-visual ability pairs engaged in a tangible programming activity. The study had three experimental conditions, representing 3 different levels of awareness. Our findings reveal that while pre-existing power dynamics heavily influenced collaboration, workspace awareness feedback was essential in fostering engagement and improving communication for both children. This paper highlights the need for designing inclusive collaborative programming systems that account for workspace awareness and individual abilities, offering insights into more effective and balanced collaborative environments."
