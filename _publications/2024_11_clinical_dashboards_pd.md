# short description of the publication
description: "This systematic review examines the use and design of clinical dashboards for monitoring Parkinson’s Disease (PD), highlighting how these visual tools are applied to represent patient data and support clinical insights. Based on 47 studies identified through searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, ACM, and IEEE according to PRISMA guidelines, the review finds that dashboards predominantly rely on sensor-based data collection that focuses on motor symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia, with comparatively fewer studies addressing other health outcomes. Despite the growing interest in dashboard applications, a significant gap exists in involving end-users in the design process, and only a minority of studies utilised participatory or co-design methods. As a result, current dashboard developments are often not tailored to the specific needs of stakeholders, limiting understanding of optimal visual formats and clinical utility. The findings underscore the need for greater emphasis on user-centred design to improve how clinical dashboards visualise and integrate diverse PD data for monitoring purposes."
