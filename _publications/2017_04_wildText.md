 alt-text: "Average Six WPM After 12 Weeks. Figure  shows participants’ input speed over 12 weeks. Overall, the average input speed in the real world improved from week 1 (M = 3.2 SD = 0.8 WPM) to week 12 (M = 5.9 SD = 0.2 WPM). As in the laboratory, with all participants improving typing speed over time. Still, learning rates were lower in real-world data with an improvement of 0.2 WPM per week. Everyday Typing is Faster than Laboratory. In Figure, we notice that everyday typing speed is consistently higher than laboratory results. The difference in performance between real-world and laboratory is 1.6 WPM and 1.4 WPM in week 1 and week 8, respectively." # provide a short description for the image #a11y
