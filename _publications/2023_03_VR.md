 alt-text: "The image presents the 9 categories of the design space: Awareness, Audio Field, Spatialization, time signsal, sound type, representation, cardinality, concurrency, and trigger. It is followed by one figure and one table that are presented in the paper and that try to better showcase the meaning of such categories" # provide a short description for the image #a11y.

# short description of the publication
description: "In this paper, the authors propose a design space to explore how to augment objects and their behaviours with an audio representation in order to make virtual environments more accessible to blind people. The authors then explored this design space in the context of two VR Boxing applications in user studies with 16 blind participants, finding several engaging approaches for the audio representation of virtual objects (e.g., the opponent's hands when attacking or defending)."
