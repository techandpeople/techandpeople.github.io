We developed a platform where usable reports are presented to clinicians, particuarly in the context of Parkinson's disease monitoring. The presented information originates from accelerometer sensors and subjective data collected over an Interactive Voice Response system.

## Abstract
Monitoring of people with Parkinson is performed in appointments and through questionnaires.
Traditional methods are still limited and imprecise in capturing motor fluctuations, which, for example,
jeopardizes accurate medication adjustments. There have been several efforts to develop sensors and
digitize these assessments, in the clinic and at home. Conversely, there have been limited efforts to
understand how clinicians deal with this gamut of information, and the opportunities and challenges of
data-driven consultation. We present DataPark, a platform that enables subjective and objective data
collection for Parkinson’s disease. Clinicians are able to schedule subjective assessments which are
then presented to patients through an interactive voice response system. On the objective component,
patients may wear an inertial sensor during physical assessments and/or during free-living periods
(i.e. wearing a bracelet for a set of days), generating usable reports on those activities. We report a
preliminary two-month deployment in a rehabilitation clinic of the objective assessment components,
and a follow-up focus group on the future integration of the subjective component.
