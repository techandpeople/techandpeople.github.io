# short description of the publication
description: "We present TACTOPI, an inclusive and playful multisensory environment that leverages tangible interaction and a robot as the main character. We investigate how TACTOPI supports play in 10 dyads of children with mixed visual abilities. We also contribute with a playful multisensory
environment, an analysis of the efect of its components on social, cognitive, and inclusive play, and design considerations for inclusive multisensory environments that prioritize play."
