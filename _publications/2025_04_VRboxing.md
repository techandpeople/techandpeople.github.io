# short description of the publication
description: "This paper presents the design and evaluation of a VR Boxing experience, developed through participatory design with an ex-professional boxer who is now blind. A user study with 15 blind participants explored their perceptions of the three-mode experience developed – Heavy Bag Training, Coach Training, and Combat – to inform the design of accessible VR experiences. Our findings highlight the importance of combining natural movement, rich auditory feedback, and welltimed guidance that also fosters user independence. Furthermore, they demonstrate the value of structured progression in complexity, while also opening opportunities for engaging spatial awareness and coordination training."
