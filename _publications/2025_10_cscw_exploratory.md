  alt-text: "Two photos side by side illustrating children engaged in activities during two different sessions. On the left, 4 children with their associated roles. The Pilot and Engineer are working at the table sharing coding blocks and the LEGO baseplate. On their right is the child portraying the Captain with earphones. Behind them on the floor, is the child with the Explorer role and a researcher. On the right, two groups working in the same classroom. The focus is on the group with three children, two researchers, and a teacher at the table. The Pilot is touching the coding blocks on the LEGO baseplate, and the Explorers are in front of each other with the LEGO-based map on the table between them." # provide a short description for the image #a11y
