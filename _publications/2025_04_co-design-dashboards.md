The Pilot and Engineer are working at the table sharing coding blocks and the LEGO baseplate. On their right is the child portraying the Captain with earphones. Behind them on the floor, is the child with the Explorer role and a researcher. On the right, two groups working in the same classroom. The focus is on the group with three children, two researchers, and a teacher at the table. The Pilot is touching the coding blocks on the LEGO baseplate, and the Explorers are in front of each other with the LEGO-based map on the table between them." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "This study investigates the design of clinical dashboards to support medical decision-making in oncology, with a focus on the visualization of individual patient data. Using a two-part qualitative approach involving interviews and co-design sessions with six oncologists, the study identifies key data requirements and design principles for effective dashboards. Findings indicate that oncology dashboards must be flexible and customizable to accommodate different treatment phases and professional roles, serving primarily as an entry point to the patient’s medical record, especially during multidisciplinary decision-making meetings. Essential design features include single-screen layouts, list-based information structures, and clear visual cues, while challenges remain in balancing visual synthesis with the need to preserve clinical detail."
