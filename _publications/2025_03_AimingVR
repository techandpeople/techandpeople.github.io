  alt-text: "The image shows a user aiming the virtual crossbow a little to the left of a distant target within the virtual environment. The user's head is represented around the reticle on the same horizontal plane as the target. The user will perceive the target position listening to their headphones for the target's sound cue (in this case, on the right side) according to where they are aiming the controller with the reticle." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "We explore how to support blind people in aiming tasks in VR using an archery scenario. We implemented three techniques: 1) Spatialized Audio, a baseline where the target emits a 3D sound to convey its location; 2) Target Confirmation, where the previous condition is augmented with secondary Beep sounds to indicate proximity to the target; and 3) Reticle-Target Perspective, where the auditory feedback conveys the relation between the target and the user's aiming reticle. In a study with 15 blind participants, Target Confirmation and Reticle-Target Perspective clearly outperformed Spatialized Audio. We discuss how our findings may support the development of VR experiences that are more accessible and enjoyable to a broader range of users."
