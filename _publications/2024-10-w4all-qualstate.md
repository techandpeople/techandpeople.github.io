# short description of the publication
description: "The paper presents QualState, a tool designed to address accessibility evaluation challenges in Single Page Applications (SPAs). By identifying and exploring various states within SPAs, QualState integrates with the automated evaluation tool QualWeb to assess accessibility across dynamic web content. The tool enhances evaluation accuracy by uncovering additional interactive elements often missed by conventional methods. Initial testing demonstrates increased coverage of accessibility issues, showcasing QualState’s potential to enhance automated accessibility evaluations in modern web environments."
