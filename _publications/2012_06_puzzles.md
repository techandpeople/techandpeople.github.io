# short description of the publication
description: "We present audio puzzle games, an interactive way of playing with music by rebuilding a song, just like the original image jigsaw puzzle, broken into pieces which are by turn randomly shuffled. The audio mode design followed a participatory approach starting from a version similar to the visual one, but around music instead of images. We report on an evaluation with 13 blind people using the proposed game application with three different songs randomly distributed."
