# short description of the publication
motivation: "Gaming has the potential to prompt feelings of togetherness through a shared activity, based on challenging goals and immersive interaction. However, it is unclear how to design games for heterogeneous groups of people — e.g., families, where there may be wide age gaps or mixed perceptual, physical and cognitive abilities. These divergences may have a precluding impact in group play. Asymmetric roles in cooperative play have been shown to increase  players' perceptions of connectedness, social engagement, immersion, and comfort with a game's controls."

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to investigate games designed for intergenerational environments and understand how asymmetry roles impact players perceptions."
