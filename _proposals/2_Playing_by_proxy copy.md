# short description of the publication
motivation: "Mainstream games tend to be highly visually demanding, with players having to assess a scene before deciding how to proceed. Despite the recent efforts in gaming accessibility many of these experiences are still unplayable by visually impaired people. Moreover, due to the nature of most games, adapting the experience and interaction methods to be accessible can lead to a diminished experience. Alternatively, one can play by proxy highly-visual games — just listening to the game audio while someone sighted is controlling the interaction. "

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to investigate a new paradigm of play. You will be tasked with exploring how playing by proxy can be provided as a crowd-source service for visually impaired people. The service will be akin to the service provided by interpreters to deaf people - serving as a way to establish a communication channel where there was none, in this case between the game and the visual impaired player. You will have to: 1) understand how to support the communication between visually impaired players, and sighted ‘proxy’ players, 2) define roles and boundaries around play that ensures a sense of control and ownership of the experience by visually impaired people; 3) establish a  service that provides playing by proxy. This work will conclude with a user study evaluating the developed service."
